Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
=================
I created this website in March 2021 using HTML and CSS. I wanted to build this
site to highlight my experiences and creativity in a way that my resume and LinkedIn don't. 

Prior to building this, I didn't have any web development experience beyond updating content on
an existing website. However, I knew that to gain experience, I had to start somewhere. After 10+ hours of 
coding and Googling, I completed my first iteration, and I've been making small updates ever since.

# What I Learned ðŸ§ 
## 1. Plan before you start.
I started with blank HTML and CSS files, and practically no idea of what I wanted my site to look like. Knowing only what sections I wanted, I worked on
different parts of the website in random order, going back in forth with no clear sense of direction. 

Next time, I would create a wireframe or write a design document to organize my ideas and increase efficiency.

## 2. Develop a solid foundation before aiming higher.
Even before my website had much content, I tried implemented a navbar using the Bootstrap framework, despite
having no experience with it. As a result, I spent the next hours reading documents and figuring out what all that code I'd just copy-pasted did.
I should've focused on finishing the most basic aspects of my website before tackling harder challenges, because while
developing that foundation, I would have gained more experience with HTML/CSS attributes, documentation and frameworks.
