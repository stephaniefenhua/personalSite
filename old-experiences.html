            <p align="left">
              Attending Superposition II was one of the most empowering experiences I've ever had. Having constantly been a gender minority in my STEM classes, it was encouraging to connect with so many girls who shared my same interest. I felt like I belonged, and I wanted every girl to feel the same way.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              I immediately joined the Superposition III organizing team, and was promoted to Superposition IV Lead Director one year later. Several months before Superposition IV, I felt conflicted about how our team's efforts would last for only 24 hours. We aimed to help bridge the gender gap in STEM, but an annual event was not enough. We had to do more.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              Starting in March 2020, three Superposition IV organizers and I spearheaded Superposition's expansion from a 24-hour hackathon to an international non-profit. Now, our chapters, mentorship programs, and events are reaching hundreds of thousands of women worldwide. Above all, the most rewarding aspect of leading Superposition is knowing that we're positively impacting others. It truly makes the effort worthwhile.
